### Branching Policy
#### Main Branches

- `master`: The `master` branch contains stable, production-ready code. It should always reflect the latest release.
- `develop`: The `develop` branch is the main integration branch where feature branches are merged. It may contain work in progress and should be tested thoroughly before merging into `master`.

#### Feature Branches

- Feature branches should be created off the `develop` branch.
- Use descriptive names for feature branches, e.g., `feature/new-feature` or `feature/issue-123`.
- Once a feature is complete, submit a pull request to merge it into `develop`.

#### Release Branches

- When preparing for a release, create a release branch from `develop`.
- Use the naming convention `release/x.x.x`, where `x.x.x` is the version number.
- Perform final testing and bug fixes on the release branch.
- Merge the release branch into both `master` and `develop` once it's ready.

#### Pull Requests

- All changes should be made via pull requests.
- Pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
- Squash and merge feature branches to maintain a clean commit history.
